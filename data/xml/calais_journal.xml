                    <date when="1833-05-14">Tuesday, May 14th, 1833</date>.
                    We arrived at <placeName ref="#calais">Calais</placeName> after a passage
                    of considerable roughness, the sea being in a state of great agitation.
                    The <geogName>English Channel</geogName>, which had seemed so narrow upon the map,
                    proved itself a formidable barrier when crossed in person.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The town of <placeName ref="#calais">Calais</placeName> presented itself
                    with all the novelty of a foreign land. The houses, built of a grey stone
                    quite unlike our <placeName ref="#london">London</placeName> brick, rose in
                    irregular lines along the quay. The <hi rend="italic">douane</hi> officers
                    examined our luggage with the most <del rend="strikethrough">tedious</del>
                    <add place="above">meticulous</add> attention to detail.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The <placeName ref="#hotel-dessein">Hotel Dessein</placeName>, where we took
                    our lodging, was a building of some antiquity and considerable reputation
                    among English travellers. <persName ref="#sterne">Sterne</persName> had
                    <sic>staid</sic><corr>stayed</corr> here, and the memory of his
                    <title level="m">Sentimental Journey</title> gave the place an air of
                    literary distinction.

                        <l>The spires of Calais caught the light</l>
                        <l rend="indent">Of evening in a golden haze,</l>
                        <l>And promised to our eager sight</l>

                <p>
                    We walked through the old town in the evening, observing the
                    <term xml:lang="fr">place d&#x2019;armes</term> and the fortifications
                    which had once withstood the siege of

                    <date when="1347">1347</date>. The walls, though much reduced from their
                    former strength, still conveyed an impression of medieval solidity.

                    <date when="1833-05-15">Wednesday, May 15th</date>. We departed
                    <placeName ref="#calais">Calais</placeName> early in the morning by
                    <hi rend="italic">diligence</hi>, the great lumbering coach of the
                    French roads. The countryside of <region>Picardy</region> unfolded itself
                    in long flat stretches of farmland, punctuated by rows of
                    <term>Lombardy poplars</term> that stood like sentinels along every road.

                <p>
                    At <placeName ref="#boulogne">Boulogne</placeName> we paused briefly.
                    The cliff scenery reminded me of our own
                    <geogName>Dover cliffs</geogName>, though the geological formations
                    <note type="gloss">Ruskin's early interest in geology is evident throughout
                    the journal, prefiguring his later scientific writings.</note> showed
                    distinct differences in their stratification. I made several
                    <term>sketches</term> in my notebook, attempting to capture the arrangement
                    of the chalk layers.

                <p>
                    The road to <placeName ref="#paris">Paris</placeName> stretched before us,
                    and with it the promise of <gap reason="illegible" extent="2" unit="words"/>
                    adventures yet to come. My father spoke of the
