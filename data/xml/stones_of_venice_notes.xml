                <head>First Impressions of Venice</head>
                <p>
                    <date when="1835-10-09">October 9th, 1835</date>. Nothing that I had read,
                    nothing that I had imagined, could have prepared me for the reality of
                    <placeName ref="#venice">Venice</placeName>. The city rose from the water
                    as if conjured by some enchantment, her palaces and churches reflected in
                    the still surface of the <geogName>lagoon</geogName> with a perfection
                    that seemed to double every beauty.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We approached by <hi rend="italic">gondola</hi>, and as we turned into the
                    <placeName ref="#grand-canal">Grand Canal</placeName>, the
                    <placeName ref="#palazzo-ducale">Ducal Palace</placeName> came into view.
                    Its arcade of pointed arches, resting upon columns of
                    <term>Istrian stone</term>, presented a harmony of proportion that I had
                    never before witnessed in any building. The upper wall, clad in a pattern
                    of <del rend="strikethrough">pink and grey</del>
                    <add place="above">rose and pearl-white</add> marble, caught the
                    afternoon light in a manner that defied <gap reason="illegible" extent="1" unit="words"/>
                    description.
                </p>

            <div type="chapter" n="2">
                <head>The Mosaics of St. Mark&#x2019;s</head>
                <p>
                    The <placeName ref="#st-marks">Basilica of St. Mark</placeName> is unlike
                    any church in <placeName ref="#england">England</placeName>. Where our
                    cathedrals achieve their effect through height and the aspiration of the
                    <term>Gothic pointed arch</term>, St. Mark&#x2019;s achieves its power through
                    colour and surface. Every wall, every vault, every dome is covered with
                    <term>mosaic</term> of gold and glass, depicting the stories of Scripture
                    with a vividness that no stained glass window could equal.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I observed with particular interest the
                    <term xml:lang="it">capitelli</term> of the exterior columns.
                    <note type="gloss">Ruskin's detailed study of Venetian column capitals
                    would later form a major section of <title level="m">The Stones of Venice</title>
                    (1851&#x2013;1853).</note>
                    Each capital told its own story in carved stone: here a scene of
                    the months and their labours, there the virtues and vices arrayed in
                    allegorical combat. The craftsmanship was of the highest order, yet bore
                    the marks of individual hands rather than mechanical reproduction.

                <lg type="poem">
                    <head>On Seeing Venice</head>
                    <lg type="stanza">
                        <l>A city built upon the waters deep,</l>

                    The <sic>colour</sic><corr>colour</corr> of the stone, particularly in
                    the late afternoon, transforms from white to the warmest gold, as if the
                    building itself were alive to the passage of the sun. I made three separate
                    <term>watercolour studies</term> attempting to fix this effect, but the
                    medium proved <del rend="strikethrough">entirely</del>
                    <add place="above">wholly</add> inadequate to the task.
